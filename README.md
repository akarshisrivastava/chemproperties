# chemproperties
A Python-based tool that fetches molecular structures from PubChem, computes key chemical properties using RDKit, and predicts solubility using a machine learning model.
Fetches SMILES representation of a chemical compound from PubChem using its name.

Computes molecular properties such as Molecular Weight, LogP, Hydrogen Bond Donors, and Acceptors using RDKit.

Implements a Linear Regression model trained on sample data to predict solubility.

Provides insights into chemical compounds for research and drug discovery.
